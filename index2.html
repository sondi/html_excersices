                I’ve been working as a <strong>UI UX designer</strong>. Working for diferent teams inside the company, following the Agile method and having di erent roles depending on the team.My main role is to deliver full responsive and stalyzed prototypes to the teams. I beggin the process by getting the requirements from the Product Owner. Then go into discussion while drawing over a white board in order to get a rough wireframe and ideas. The following step is to create mobile wireframes,test and validate them. Then I scale to desktop and get back to the conversation with the whole team. After that, I go into rapid prototyping (HTML, Sass & JQuery).

                I worked hand in hand with the Art and Creative Directors, managing the aplication ́s website, marketing web assets and social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr. I illustrated motion frames for more than 6 interactive books for kids and produced sound design. Completing User Experience analysis and User Interface for our iPad platform were apart of my monthly assignments as well.
                Working at a start-up gave me many opportunities to pitch ideas and work close to designers and programmers with more experience in the Gaming and Design industry.
